Please always do `git pull` before `git commit`.

If you have to do `git push --force` or `git rebase`, be cautious or come to Jake.

Submodule usage
---
As Peter leads another team doing MIR and their code is open-source(Thanks!), the `instrument-recognition` folder is added as `submodule`. Usage:
    
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Please don't directly modify the code in the submodule, the folder will be periodically updated by Jake.
